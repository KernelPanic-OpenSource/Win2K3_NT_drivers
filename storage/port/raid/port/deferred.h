Routine Description:

    Process any outstanding items on the deferred queue. This routine is
    only callable from within a DPC routine. Other callers that need to
    check for deferred items to process should use RaidProcessDeferredItems.

Arguments:

    Queue - Deferred queue to process from.

    DeviceObject - Supplies the DeviceObject associated with this
        deferred queue.

Return Value:

    TRUE - If there was an item on the deferred queue that was processed.

    FALSE - Otherwise.

/*++

Routine Description:

    Process any outstanding items on the deferred queue. Unlike
    RaidProcessDeferredItemsForDpc, this routine checks for recursion,
    and therefore may be called from within routines called back
    from the DPC.

Arguments:

    Queue - Deferred queue to process from.

Return Value:

    TRUE - If there was an item on the deferred queue that was processed.

    FALSE - Otherwise.
