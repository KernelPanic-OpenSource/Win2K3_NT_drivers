Module Name:

    ioqueue.c

Abstract:

    Implementation of the raid IO_QUEUE object.

Author:

    Matthew D Hendel (math) 22-June-2000

Revision History:

Comments:

    The IoQueue class serves basically the same function as the NT I/O
    queue that is a part of the driver's device object. We use a
    different queue because SCSI has different serialization requirements
    than the standard NT driver model supports. (See the
    EXTENDED_DEVICE_QUEUE object for more information on these differences.)

Future:

    We may want to consider is integrating the EXTENDED_DEVICE_QUEUE
    class and the IO_QUEUE class into the same class. Though logically,
    these can be implemented separately (as they are done in the kernel)
    we may be able to get performance enhancements and code quality
    improvements by putting these in the same class. The only interface
    the port driver is concerned with is the IO_QUEUE interface.

    It would be nice if resource allocation (of queue tags) and the IO
    queue were more closely integrated. As it is, the tag allocation and
    the IO queue both primarily track the number of outstanding requests
    and there is some danger that these numbers could get out of sync.

Routine Description:

    Initialize an IO_QUEUE object.

Arguments:

    IoQueue - Supplies a pointer to the IO_QUEUE object to initialize.

    DeviceObject - Supplies a pointer to a device object that this
            IoQueue is for.

    Gateway - Supplies the IO Gateway to manage the interaction between
            the different device queues.

    StartIo - Supplies a pointer to a StartIo function that will be
            called when there are irps that need to be handled.

    QueueDepth - Supplies the initial queue depth for the IoQueue. This
            value can by dynamically changed at a later time.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS code.

Routine Description:

    Attempt to start an IO Request for this driver. If resources are

Arguments:

    Irp - Irp to execute.

    Flags - Supplies flags to send down to the device queue.
    
    CancelFunction - Pointer to a cancelation function for the associated
            IRP.

Return Value:

    TRUE - If the IO was started.

    FALSE - If it was not started.

/*++

Routine Description:

    StartNextPacket dequeues the next IRP on the IoQueue (if any), and
    calls the IoQueue's StartIo routine for that IRP.

    In addition, if the IoQueue has changed, this routine will remove any
    "extra" items from the device queue and call the IoQueue's StartIo
    routine for those extra items. In this sense, "extra" items on the io
    queue are items on the queue when the queue is not busy. This happens
    when the io queue is increased in size while it's busy, or when the
    queue is frozen and items get queued to it, and then it's resumed.
    
Arguments:

    IoQueue -

    Cancelable -

    Context -

Return Value:

    TRUE - If we started the next io operation.

    FALSE - Otherwise.
