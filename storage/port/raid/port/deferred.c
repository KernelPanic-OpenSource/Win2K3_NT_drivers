Routine Description:

    Create an empty deferred queue. After a deferred queue has been created
    it can be delete by calling RaidDeleteDeferedQueue.

Arguments:

    Queue - Deferred queue to initialize.

Return Value:

    None.

Routine Description:

    Initialize a deferred queue.

Arguments:

    Queue - Supplies the deferred queue to initialize.

    DeviceObject - Supplies the device object the deferred queue is
            created on. Since the deferred queue is created using a
            device queue, the supplied device object is also the
            device object we will create the DPC on.

    Depth - Supplies the depth of the deferred queue.

    ItemSize - Supplies the size of each element on the deferred queue.

    ProcessDeferredItem - Supplies the routine that will be called when
            a deferred item is ready to be handled.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS code.
