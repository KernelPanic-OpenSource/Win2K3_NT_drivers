Abstract:

	Declaration of a gateway class that manages multiple interrelated
	sub-devices on a device.

	The IO gateway keeps track of elements queued to a device. The
	gateway is only necessary for device/driver pairs that have multiple
	independent device queues per physical device. A SCSI port driver,
	for example, can queue items on a per-logical-unit basis instead of
	per-HBA basis. The advantage of a per-logical-unit queue is that if a
	logical-unit becomes busy, requests for different logical units can
	be submitted to the adapter while the first logical unit is frozen.

	The gateway object is the object that coordinates the communication
	to the physical HBA.

						 ---
	 -------------		| H |
	| LUN 1 Queue | --> | B |
	 -------------		| A |
						|   |      ----------
	 -------------		| G |     | 	     |
	| LUN 2 Queue | -->	| a | --> | HBA  ----
	 -------------		| t |     |     |
						| e |      ------
	 -------------		| w |
	| LUN 1 Queue | -->	| a |
	 -------------		| y |
						 ---

	The gateway keeps track of whether the HBA is busy or frozen, how
	many outstanding requests are on the HBA, and, when the HBA is busy,
	the algorithm it uses to clear it's busy state.
