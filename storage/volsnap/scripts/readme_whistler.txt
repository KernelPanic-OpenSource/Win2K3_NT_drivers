Creating a snapshot using the command-line utility

You can create a snapshot on a certain set of  volumes by 
running vss_demo.exe. You should choose the default values 
for vss_demo prompts excepting maybe for the Volume Name 
prompt where you must put the mount point path (terminated 
with backslash) for that volume, for example "F:\". Beware 
that the created snapshots are lost after a reboot.

Before creating the snapshot on a FAT volume you must first 
configure the diff area for that volume. See the "Moving a 
Diff Area... " section below for details. You do not need 
to configure the diff area for an NTFS volume before 
creating a snapshot.


Example:

Z:\nt\drivers\storage\volsnap\vss\bin\i386>vss_demo
Snapshot Set creation succeeded. 
GUID = {932ae8c4-1b97-4032-8062-0ab93fce92fc}

The name of snapshot #0 : \Device\HarddiskVolumeSnapshot3

Moving a Diff Area from the Default Location

To move a diff area from the default location to another
drive, execute the following commands from the command 
line after each boot. Note that "F:" is the name of the 
target drive for the snapshot and "G:" is the name of the 
drive the diff area will be moved to. Also, the "F:" drive 
must be FAT and the "G:" drive must be NTFS. Beware that 
the diff area settings are lost after a reboot.

Example:
	vsclrda F:
	vsda F: G:

Using the sample writers

A writer is by definition an ordinary application that 
can listen for snapshot-related events. For running the 
command-line sample writer in this SDK you need only 
to run tsub.exe in a command window. Then, in a separate 
command window you must create a snapshot using vss_demo.
You will notice that the running tsub.exe gets notified 
before and after a snapshot gets created.
