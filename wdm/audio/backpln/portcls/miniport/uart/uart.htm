<H3>SUMMARY</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
This sample is a MIDI UART miniport driver which provides an interface to the MPU-401 chip. <P>
The MIDI port driver, which is built into PortCls.sys, insulates the miniport and connects it to the rest of the system. The sample handles
one input stream and one output stream.  It compiles in the 64-bit environment and is compatible with both Alpha and x86 platforms.<P>
Plug and Play and Power Management are handled automatically on the miniport's behalf by PortCls.<P>

<H3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" 
SIZE=2><P>

Type <B>build</B> in the \\Ntddk\Src\Wdm\Audio\Miniport\Uart directory.  A 
successful build produces Uart.lib, which can be linked into an adapter driver along with Stdunk.lib.<P>


<H3>RESOURCES</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
This exact miniport is already included in PortCls. We have provided the source code as a starting point for those that need to augment it, as well as those that need to create completely new miniports. 
This miniport interfaces to the port driver of type MIDI. A new port, type DMUS, was introduced in Microsoft® Windows 98® Second Edition (SE) and Microsoft Windows 2000.  The DMUS port provides higher functionality than the MIDI port, so if you are creating your own miniport, consider interfacing to DMUS instead of MIDI. The advantage of DMUS miniport drivers is that they are visible to DirectMusic APIs, unlike MIDI miniport drivers. Additionally, DMUS miniports are still visible to the older MIDI APIs. In short, DirectMusic miniports have the benefits of both backward compatibility and advanced functionality. 
<p>
Please refer to the SB16 sample to learn how to use the built-in miniport.<p>


DirectMusic kernel support is not available in Windows 98, only in Windows 98SE and Windows 2000 and later.
