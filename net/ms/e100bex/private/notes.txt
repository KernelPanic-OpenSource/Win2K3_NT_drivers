Both the x86 and ia64 libraries(mp_pm.lib) produced by this 
directory have been manually copied to ..\lib location and 
are checked in as binary files. The DDK picks them up from 
that location. 

The ..\lib location contains the free version of mp_pm.lib 

Having both binaries present in the DDK allows developers 
to compile both x86 and Ia64 versions of the sample driver 
from a single version of the DDK.
