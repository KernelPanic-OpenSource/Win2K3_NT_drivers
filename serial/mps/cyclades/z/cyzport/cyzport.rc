// History
//
// 1.0.19.0 10/22/01 Fix from Win2k SP2 applied: CyzPowerDispatch doesn't
//                   call PoStartNextPowerIrp and CyzCompleteRequest when
//                   CyzIRPPrologue returns STATUS_PENDING.
// 1.0.18.0 07/05/01 Applying changes from DDK RC1: Do not complete Irp when
//                   CyzIRPPrologue returns STATUS_PENDING. (CyyIRPPrologue
//                   returns STATUS_PENDING when device is in Stopped state.)
//                   Removal of DbgBreakPoint in CyzLogInit to prevent
//                   breakpoints in low resource simulation with checked
//                   builds.
//                   Following changes in serial were not applied: use of 
//                   SetDeviceIsOpened instead of updating DeviceIsOpened
//                   flag directly; no power down after Start up or when
//                   closing port if EnablePowerManagement is set in the
//                   Registry.
// 1.0.17.0 07/02/01 No need to send Power Irp to power up the device during
//                   IRP_MN_START_DEVICE.
// 1.0.16.0 05/31/01 Check if PowerState is PowerDeviceD0 in CyzTxStart.
//                   CyzHandleModemUpdate was not resetting TXHolding when
//                   modem flow control was reset.
// 1.0.15.0 05/04/01 More fixes for Driver Verifier: IoMarkIrpPending required
//                   when STATUS_PENDING returned. CyzSystemPowerComplete 
//                   completing Irp when PoRequestPowerIrp fails. 
//                   IoMarkIrpPending called when Irp->PendingReturned set
//                   in the IoCompletion routine of Device Power Irp.
// 1.0.14.0 04/27/01 _WIN64 code removed. Set busNumber to 0xFFFFFFFF
//                   when call to get DevicePropertyBusNumber fails;
//                   device name will use static currentInstance whenever 
//                   busNumber is 0xFFFFFFFF.
// 1.0.13.0 04/25/01 Delete #defines for VER_COMPANYNAME_STR, 
//                   VER_PRODUCTNAME_STR, VER_PRODUCTVERSION and
//                   VER_PRODUCTVERSION_STR to fix compilation
//                   warnings.
// 1.0.12.0 04/18/01 Device name for _WIN64 will use static currentInstance
//                   number. This is because cyclad-z cannot retrieve
//                   the PCI slot number in 64-bit system.
// 1.0.11.0 04/16/01 Fix for Driver Verifier: IoMarkIrpPending required
//                   when STATUS_PENDING returned.
// 1.0.10.0 04/02/01 Just version change.
// 1.0.9.0  03/20/01 RtlAppendUnicodeToString was failing with 
//                   STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL when updating 
//                   SymbolicLinkName in CyzUndoExternalNaming.
//                   CyzReadSymName is used now.
//                   Device name changed from \Device\Cyzport?Pci? to
//                   \Device\Pci?Cyzport?.
// 1.0.8.0  03/14/01 Changes for serial from DDK 2416 (Whistler pre-Beta2)
//                   to DDK 2446 (Whistler pre-Beta2) applied.
// 1.0.7.0  03/12/01 Changes for serial from DDK 2195 (Windows 2000) to 
//                   DDK 2416 (Whistler pre-Beta2) applied.
// 1.0.6.0  03/12/01 Just version change.
// 1.0.5.0  03/02/01 cyzpnp.c: Device name is no longer using static instance
//                   number that is incremented every time the driver
//                   is loaded; instead it is using a fixed name based
//                   on the PCI slot and port number. This change fixed
//                   the Rename-Disable-Enable problem. 
// 1.0.4.0  02/26/01 Device SET_POWER is no longer waiting for kernel event 
//                   during power up; it is setting an IoCompletion routine. 
//                   System SET_POWER changed to return STATUS_PENDING, set an
//                   IoCompletion routine, and request Device power Irp in the 
//                   IoCompletion routine. The power management has the
//                   same changes as in Y 1.0.7.0.
// 1.0.3.0  02/23/01 Fix for Hyperterminal not working after Standby or 
//                   Hibernation: CyzDisableHw is not longer called during
//                   power down. CyzDisableHw would send C_CM_IOCTL and
//                   C_CM_RESET to the firmware, and this would reset the 
//                   modem output signals. The DCD change event in the other 
//                   Hyperterminal session would cause the Read Irp to be 
//                   cancelled, and no other Read Irp would be sent to the
//                   driver.
//                   CyzReset called during power up only if port is opened.
// 1.0.2.0  01/29/01 Check for invalid get and put read from PtZfIntQueue in 
//                   CyzPollingDpc.
//          01/25/01 Driver built with Whistler DDK 2416.
//                   64-bit Compilation error fixed in cyzinit.c.
// 1.0.1.0  12/06/00 Driver built with Whistler DDK (Beta1).
//                   Fix for Hibernation: CyzSetPowerD3 no longer paged code due
//                   to IRQL raise by spin lock.
// 1.0.0.16 11/20/00 Check if Extension->PtZfIntQueue is valid before accessing it.
// 1.0.0.15 11/10/00 Fix deadlock during Open: CyzMarkOpen was trying to acquire
//                   PollingLock inside PollLock, while the CyzPollingDcp was acquiring
//                   PollLock inside PollingLock. Replace CyzDisableHwAndTimer
//                   by CyzDisableHw and CyzTryToDisableTimer. Change CyzReleaseResources
//                   to protect CyzCleanLists with PollingLock instead of PollLock.
// 1.0.0.14 11/02/00 MmMapIoSpace mapping only memory used by single port
//                   instead of mapping whole 1MB board memory.
// 1.0.0.13     -    None.
// 1.0.0.12 10/11/00 Fix Rename-Disable-Enable problem: SymbolicLinkName
//                   was being changed by the Property Page, but driver
//                   was trying to delete the original name. 
// 1.0.0.11 10/09/00 Added support to interrupt mode when POLL is not defined
//                   during compilation time (in the sources file).
// 1.0.0.10 09/22/00 Change cyzportp.h and cyzpoll.c to support 64bit environment.
//                   Add #if _WIN64 code in cyzpoll.c.
// 1.0.0.9  -        None.
// 1.0.0.8 08/15/00  Fix CYZ_INCOMPATIBLE_FIRMWARE log to have required version as a 
//                   parameter instead of hardcoding to 3.2.3.
//         08/10/00  Do not read PPPaware from the Registry, we are removing support
//                   to PPPaware.
//                   Do not set/reset DTR/RTS when FIRMWARE_HANDSHAKE defined. 
//                   Add #ifndef FIRMWARE_HANDSHAKE in cyzpoll.c.
// 1.0.0.7 08/08/00  Read WriteComplete flag from the Registry. The user can now configure
//                   the driver to complete Write immediatly or after fw buffer is 
//                   empty. The default is complete immediatly.
// 1.0.0.6 08/04/00  Read PPPaware flag from the Registry. The PPPaware mode will be
//                   enabled by default, to fix WsStress UDP/SPX test error.
//                   Check if firmware version is at least 3.2.3.
// 1.0.0.5 07/21/00  Changes from cyyport from 1.0.0.12 to 1.0.0.27 were applied.
//                   KeInitilizeSpinLock was not being called for pDispatch->PollingLock.
//                   #if 0 removed from pragma alloc_text in cyzmodem.c.
//                   CyzCreateOpen changed from PAGESER to PAGESRP0.
//                   Minor change: Delete functions that refer to CD1400 from cyzport.h.
// 1.0.0.2 02/29/00  Fix IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE to detach cyzport from stack only
//                   after calling lower drivers. CyzRemoveDevObj() had to be 
//                   changed for this.
// 1.0.0.1 02/28/00  Comment change.
